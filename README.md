# WikiTags: Editable tagging system for real life

![Python application](https://github.com/laurentperrinet/WikiTags/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

> Beware: for use in real-life!

Whenever you need to create custom-made tags for storage, archival, tupperwareÂ©, ... you may want to use a system of labels which you can read or write.

This small script creates a set of QR codes that you can stick on any object. Each point to the URL of a wiki (that is an editable page): Scan it with your phone to see what the tag points to and maybe edit it.
